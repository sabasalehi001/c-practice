# File Peek

A simple directory listing utility, similar to `ls`.

## Build

To build the project, use the provided Makefile:

```bash
make
```

This will create an executable file named `app`.

## Run

To run the utility, provide a directory path as an argument. If no argument is provided, it will list the current directory.

```bash
./app /path/to/directory
```

**Example:**

```bash
./app .
```

This will list the files and directories in the current directory.
