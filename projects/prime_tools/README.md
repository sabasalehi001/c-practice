# Prime Number Toolkit

This project provides a basic toolkit for working with prime numbers, including:

*   **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** Generates a list of prime numbers up to a specified limit.
*   **Prime Factorization:** Decomposes a given number into its prime factors.

## Build

To build the project, use the following command:

```bash
make
```

This will compile the `main.c` file and create an executable named `app`.

## Run

To run the program, execute the following command:

```bash
./app
```

The program will prompt you to choose between generating primes using the Sieve or performing prime factorization.

## Example

**Prime Factorization**

If you choose prime factorization and enter the number `28`, the output will be:

```
Prime factors: 2 2 7
```
