# Password Strength Checker

This simple C program checks the strength of a password based on its length and the character classes it contains (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters).

## Build

```bash
make
```

## Run

```bash
./app <password>
```

For example:

```bash
./app P@sswOrd123
```

This will output a strength score.
