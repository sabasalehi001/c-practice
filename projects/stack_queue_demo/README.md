# Stack and Queue Library Demo

This project demonstrates a simple stack and queue library implemented in C.

## Build

To build the project, use the following command:

```bash
make
```

This will compile the `main.c` file and link it with the stack and queue library code to create an executable named `app`.

## Run

To run the compiled executable, use the following command:

```bash
./app
```

## Example

This is a sample output of running the program:

```
